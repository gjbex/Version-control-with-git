# Hands-on

Material for a hands-no session as part of the training session "Version
control with git".

## What is it?

1. `version_control_with_git.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that can be used to have some
    hands-on practice.  Note that you need a Jupyter instance with a Bash backend to
     run it.
1. `GitBisect`: illustration of how to use the `git bisect` command to identify
   the commit that broke an application.
