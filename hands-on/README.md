# Hands-on

Material for a hands-no session as part of the training session "Version
control with git".

## What is it?

1. `version_control_with_git.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook that can be used to have
   some hands-on practice.  Note that you need a Jupyter instance with a Bash
   backend to run it.
1. `git-bisect`: illustration of how to use the `git bisect` command to
   identify the commit that broke an application.
1. `changing-your-mind`: illustration of `git restore`, `git revert`, `git
   reset`, and `git rebase` to change your mind about a commit.
1. `merge-squash`: illustration of the `git merge --squash` command to merge a
   branch without keeping the history of the commits in that branch, as well as
   the `git rebase -i` command to rewrite the history of a branch before
   merging it.
