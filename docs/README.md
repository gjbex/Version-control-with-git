Reproducibility is an important aspect of scientific research.  A version
control system such as git can help considerably in this respect.  It is also
and excellent tool for collaboration.  You can use version control on
  * the text of publications when there are multiple authors;
  * source code of applications that evolve over time;
  * scripts for workflows, data preprocessing or postprocessing.

A version control systems helps you keep track of
  * what changed,
  * when it was changed,
  * who made the change.


# Learning outcomes

When you complete this training you will be able to

  * use the git version control system in a single-user setting;
  * use the git version control system in a multi-user setting;
  * work with branches to separate concerns;
  * examine the history of a project.
